"""Thread-safe wrapper around the liquidctl Kraken Z3 driver.

This is the single choke-point for *all* device I/O in OpenKraken.  Every public
method serializes driver access through an internal :class:`threading.RLock`, so
the engine thread, startup, and shutdown can all touch the device safely.

Design notes
------------
* ``liquidctl`` is imported lazily (inside :meth:`KrakenDevice.connect`) so that
  merely importing this module never enumerates USB devices or touches
  ``/dev/hidraw*``.  Only the driver class :class:`KrakenZ3` is referenced, and
  only for ``isinstance`` matching.
* The device on the target machine (``1e71:3012`` "NZXT Kraken 2024 Elite RGB")
  is matched by driver class ``KrakenZ3`` and vendor id ``0x1e71``.
* Status / initialize tuple lists are parsed *by label substring* (case
  insensitive), never by index, because the driver returns them sorted and the
  order is not guaranteed.
* Any driver exception (``OSError``, ``ValueError``, assertion failures, USB
  errors, ...) is caught, logged, and turned into a failure value.  On I/O-style
  errors the device is marked disconnected so the engine can attempt to
  reconnect.

_LCD_TOTAL_MEMORY = 24320

#: Number of LCD buckets the sensor-frame streamer rotates through. Two would be
#: the minimum for flicker-free double-buffering, but a silent HID switch de-sync
#: (the driver's ``_switch_bucket`` can falsely report success on a stale reply)
#: then leaves our "live bucket" pointer one ahead of the firmware's -- and with
#: only two slots the very next frame reuses the bucket actually on screen ->
#: black, nothing logged. Rotating through more buckets and always reusing the
#: OLDEST one means such a de-sync only shows a one-frame-stale image instead of
#: blanking; it self-corrects on the next good switch. The device has 16 buckets
#: and ample memory (each slot here is _LCD_TOTAL_MEMORY/N >> a frame), so 6 is
#: cheap and tolerates a burst of up to N-2 = 4 consecutive de-syncs before the
#: reuse pointer could reach the displayed bucket (the self-heal covers rarer
#: bursts). Slots are packed contiguously, one frame (``data_size``) wide each,
#: so N * data_size must stay under :data:`_LCD_TOTAL_MEMORY` (6 * ~1601 = ~9.6k
#: << 24320 for the 640x640 raw-RGBA frame). See :meth:`set_lcd_sensor_frame`.
_LCD_RING_BUCKETS = 6

#: Consecutive streamed-frame failures (the firmware rejecting bucket delete/setup
#: with status 0x09/0x04 -- a wedged LCD bucket memory) after which we force a full
#: device RECONNECT to recover.  Verified in the field: the in-process liquid->image
#: re-assert does NOT clear this wedge (it persisted through 6 self-heals over an
#: hour), but a fresh ``connect()`` + ``initialize()`` does.  ~4 * the sensor
#: interval (~8 s) before recovery kicks in; small enough to recover fast, large
#: enough not to reconnect on a lone transient hiccup. See
#: :meth:`set_lcd_sensor_frame` / :meth:`_note_lcd_frame_stuck`.
_LCD_FAIL_RECONNECT_THRESHOLD = 4

#: Consecutive HID read desyncs tolerated before giving up on flushes and
#: reconnecting to resync the stream.  Deliberately far above
#: :data:`_LCD_FAIL_RECONNECT_THRESHOLD`: a desync burst is normal while the
#: firmware drains an error storm and clears itself, whereas each reconnect
#: emits an init burst that provokes the next desync.  Sharing one counter with
#: the bucket-wedge escalation turned that into a self-sustaining loop.
_LCD_DESYNC_RECONNECT_THRESHOLD = 15

#: Substring identifying liquidctl's HID request/reply desync assertion
#: ("missing messages (attempts=12, missing=1)").  It reports a crowded read
#: stream on a healthy device, so it is handled by flushing rather than by
#: dropping the connection.
_DESYNC_MARKER = "missing messages"

#: Plain (no-clear) re-upload attempts for transient HID-contention failures
#: before resorting to a bucket clear, and total clear+retry attempts after that.
#: Kept small: each plain retry consumes a fresh bucket, so over-retrying just
#: hastens memory exhaustion (and its clear). The switch guard already keeps a
#: failed frame off-screen, so a skipped frame merely holds the last good image.
_LCD_PLAIN_RETRIES = 2
_LCD_CLEAR_RETRIES = 2

#: How many times to re-issue a ``set_screen`` whose *opening handshake* hit a
#: read desync (:data:`_DESYNC_MARKER`), flushing the stale reports between
#: attempts. Every set_screen -- brightness/orientation/liquid included, not
#: just uploads -- begins by asking the device for its current orientation and
#: brightness and reading until the reply arrives, so a crowded stream loses a
#: one-shot setting outright rather than merely skipping a frame. Measured on a
#: Kraken 2024 Elite: 12/12 calls succeed with exclusive access, and the
#: assertion appears only while another reader holds the node. The flush is what
#: makes retrying worthwhile -- re-issuing without it just re-reads the same
#: desynced queue and fails identically.

        frames, which forces a clear that flips to the firmware liquid screen),
